# Modular Data Profiler 2025 ðŸš€

*A Hackathon Project â€” Honoring the Unsung Heroes of Machine Learning*

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This project shines a light on the essential, yet often underappreciated, work of data profiling and preprocessing in machine learning. While sophisticated models often steal the show, itâ€™s the data engineers and scientists who ensure that clean, well-understood data powers every ML pipeline.

## ðŸ’¡ Vision

Our goal is to build a dataframe libraryâ€”drawing inspiration from NVIDIA RAPIDSâ€”that leverages GPU acceleration for high-performance computations.

## ðŸ“Š Numerical Analysis

We have implemented GPU-optimized functions for `MAX`, `MIN`, and `MEAN` calculations.

**Input Data Shape:** `(100,)`  
**Sample Input:** `[44. 41. 70. 60.  2. 57. 76. 77. 56. 35.]`

| Operation | Result | Expected | Status                  |
|-----------|--------|----------|-------------------------|
| Max       | 99.0   | 99.0     | âœ… Verification passed! |
| Min       | 0.0    | 0.0      | âœ… Verification passed! |
| Mean      | 49.5   | 49.5     | âœ… Verification passed! |
