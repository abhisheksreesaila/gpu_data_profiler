Modular Data Profiler 2025
Hackathon Project - Celebrating the Unappreciated Work of Machine Learning
ðŸš€ Overview
This project represents the often overlooked but critical foundation of machine learning: data profiling and preprocessing. While flashy models get the spotlight, the real heroes are the data engineers and scientists who ensure clean, well-understood data flows through ML pipelines.
Our modular data profiler brings GPU acceleration and extensive functionality to this underappreciated but essential work, making data exploration and validation faster and more comprehensive than ever before.
