# Modular Data Profiler 2025 ðŸš€

*A Hackathon Project - Celebrating the Unappreciated Work of Machine Learning*

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This project represents the often overlooked but critical foundation of machine learning: data profiling and preprocessing. While flashy models get the spotlight, the real heroes are the data engineers and scientists who ensure clean, well-understood data flows through ML pipelines.

## ðŸ’¡ Vision

Our vision is to develop a dataframe library, inspired by NVIDIA's RAPIDS, to perform computations on the GPU.

## ðŸ“Š Numerical Analysis

Currently, we have implemented a GPU-optimized `MAX` function. Here is a sample of its execution:

```text
Input data shape: (100,)
Input data sample: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]

Result:
Max value: 99

Expected:
Max value: 99

Verification successful!
